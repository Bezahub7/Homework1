    "text": "First Section:\n\nWhat do you think being a data scientist is about?\nI think being a data scientist to its core, is all about extracting insights and solving real-world problems using data.\nA data scientist is involved in the tasks below (this is not an exhaustive list )\n - Cleaning data\n - Transforming data\n - Analyzing data\n - Visualizing data\n - Building models\n - Communicating findings \nWhat differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nData scientists and statisticians both deal with cleaning, transforming, modeling, visualizing, interpreting and communicating the data. However, the type of data the two deal with (structured vs unstructured, big data) and the tools that they use can be different. Moreover, data scientist are heavy on the programming side while statisticians are heavy on theoretical aspects such as study design.\nHow do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\nAt my work, Iâ€™m used to dealing with a more structured, well designed and smaller data ,doing descriptive and a bit of inferential statistics. But, I also like to challenge my self and learn more data science tools to solve more real-world problems.\n\n\n\nSecond Section:\n\nProbability density function:\n\n\ny &lt;- density(iris$Petal.Width)\n\n\nDetermine the\n\nclass\nType, and\nStructure of the object y\n\n\n\nclass(y)\n\n[1] \"density\"\n\ntypeof(y)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\nstr(y)\n\nList of 7\n $ x        : num [1:512] -0.656 -0.648 -0.64 -0.633 -0.625 ...\n $ y        : num [1:512] 0.00163 0.0018 0.00199 0.00219 0.00241 ...\n $ bw       : num 0.252\n $ n        : int 150\n $ call     : language density.default(x = iris$Petal.Width)\n $ data.name: chr \"iris$Petal.Width\"\n $ has.na   : logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"density\"\n\n\n\nPlot y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe echo: false option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed)."
